        <h2>Why Attend the Lectionary Reading Week?</h2>

<p>The <strong>Reading Week for Lectionary Preachers</strong> is time set aside to sow seeds of excellence in next year&rsquo;s preaching ministry. The Reading Week is an investment in ministry which every effective preacher owes his or her congregation; it is the &ldquo;seed corn&rdquo; for time-starved pastors. Before your parishioner&rsquo;s needs have taken all your ministry time, lay this week aside to listen attentively to scripture and the Holy Spirit, to roll up your sleeves, and plant the seeds for next year&rsquo;s preaching ministry.</p>

<p>What Will You Do During the Lectionary Reading Week?</p>

<ul>
<li>Hear the Gospel lessons for the entire lectionary year read aloud as you take notes and jot down your ideas</li>
<li>Spend valuable quiet time developing themes, objectives, and images for each individual Sunday.</li>
<li>Identify potential preaching series, topical sequences, and an underlying &ldquo;theme&rdquo; for the entire lectionary year</li>
<li>Engage in interactive discussion, season-by-season, of themes, observations, and insights for the coming lectionary year</li>
<li>Create strategies for &ldquo;passenger Sundays&rdquo;, where external themes are imposed upon your worship and preaching (Scout Sunday, Music Appreciation Sunday, community or world crises, secular holidays, etc.)</li>
<li>Coordinate your preaching schedule with family vacation plans and other personal calendar issues</li>
<li>Participate in interactive dialogue with colleagues as we exegete our culture and our congregations</li>
<li>Share with colleagues about blind spots, hurdles, and impediments to weekly sermon preparation</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>Schedule, Registration, and more&hellip;</h2>

<p>For all the details <a href="/assets/2015-Reading-Week-Brochure.pdf">download the brochure for the 2015 Lectionary Reading Week with Registration Form</a>.</p>

<p>The Reading Week is typically held in September and begins on Tuesday with check-in from 10am to Noon, commencing with lunch, then right to work. Work continues through Friday morning, concluding with worship at 11:45am. Participants should plan on being present for the Full Reading Week. (see downloadable brochure for current dates and costs)</p>

<p>Your registration fee for the Lectionary Reading Week covers the cost of all program materials, lodging for 3 nights, and all meals. The Reading Week is considered a &ldquo;work week&rdquo;, rather than retreat or &ldquo;time off&rdquo;, therefore you are encouraged to use your Continuing Education budget or seek financial support from your church in order to attend.</p>

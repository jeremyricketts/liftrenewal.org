        <p>In all of history, there has never been a king like Jesus. He holds no earthly crown or scepter. He covets no earthly throne or dominion. He kneels as a servant, welcomes children, touches the untouchable, and mingles with the outcasts. He came not be served, but to serve, and...</p>

        <p>Among the many Kingdom teachings of Jesus we find this jarring question: “why do you call me ‘Lord, Lord’ and do not do what I tell you?” From the earliest of times the church has recognized that anyone can claim the name of Jesus, and make a pretense of calling...</p>

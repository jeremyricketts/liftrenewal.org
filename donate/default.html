<h3>In-Kind Donations</h3>

<p>Smart Givin... transfer stock to LIFT Renewal Ministries!</p>

<p>Looking for a great way to make your charitable giving go farther?  Here is a popular strategy.</p>

<p>If you have a company stock that has increased in value since purchased, you can maximize the value of your gift to LIFT by transferring the actual stock and avoid capital-gains tax on the profit, and reduce your overall taxable income.</p>

<p>Here's an example:  Say you bought 100 shares of stock at $10 per share and now (over a year later) they are worth $20 per share. If you sell the stock, you will have $1,000 in profit and owe the Federal (and perhaps State) capital gains tax. In California (2013) in this example; a total tax of 33%, $330, so that leaves $670 to send on to LIFT.</p>

<p>If instead, you were to simply transfer the stock directly to LIFT, you can deduct the total value of the stock, now $2000, as a donation to LIFT, reducing your tax liability by that amount.</p>

<p>That makes a very big difference in the value to the Ministry and could make a big difference in your total taxable income. A Win-Win.</p>

<p>If you wish to make a gift of stock to LIFT Renewal Ministries, please call the LIFT office and we’ll walk you though the process.  Essentially, your brokerage institution that holds your stock will send it to a brokerage account setup for LIFT (501c3) a non-profit organization. It is very simple.</p>

<p>More money means more Ministry opportunity for those we serve!</p>

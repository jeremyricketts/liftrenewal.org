      <p><strong>LIFT Ministries</strong> will once again present this Seminar designed to strengthen,encourage,and equip those persons entrusted with running the church office and assisting the Pastor &ndash; <strong>Administrative Assistants, Office Managers, Church Secretaries</strong>, etc. This is a very important ministry to which God calls us in order to use our spiritual gifts to their fullest to give glory to God and strengthen the Body of Christ.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll spend a day away from the office to worship, and engage in prayer and Bible study together, then take a good look at the responsibilities and challenges of your job through the lens of Ministry.  Understanding that church administration is not merely a set of tasks on a job description, LIFT is offering an opportunity for participants to indeed embrace their roles as ministry,identify a variety of spiritual and practical resources available to them, and be renewed as they return to their workplace. </p>

<p><strong>“The Ministry of the Church Office&quot;</strong> is facilitated by <strong>Judy Gillham</strong>, herself a veteran of church office administration, and currently serves as the Ministries Coordinator for LIFT Ministries. She is a woman of deep prayer and great faith, who believes that we are charged with working “as unto the Lord” in all things. Judy brings experience, compassion, and her sense of humor to this seminar and is eager to share this special day with her colleagues.</p>

<p><strong>Contact St. Andrew UMC for more information, and to register. (805) 937-2470</strong></p>

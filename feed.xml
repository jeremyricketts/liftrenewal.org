      <title>Ministry in Ghana</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Team of 6 clergy and laypersons will travel to Accra, Ghana, in West Africa, this summer for a third mission trip to strengthen local church leaders in disciple-making. Your prayers are welcomed as they travel and serve! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past 2 years have focused on the &amp;ldquo;Big 5&amp;rdquo; of discipleship and building a Discipling Network which reaches out beyond the walls of the church. Following up on those previous seminars, LIFT this year will have conversation with a core group of leaders to encourage them forward in their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LIFT Team members will also take part in evening Revival Worship services and preach in local congregations on Sunday morning. A visit to the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;LIFT Renewal Center&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; currently under construction will be included, to view the progress of this special project and pray with the construction team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The LIFT Mission Team members:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev. William Johnson &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Bob Denham &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev. Tonya Harris &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev. Tom Rothhaar &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Nesamony &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judy Gillham &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mission dates are: August 11 through 22, 2015.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your support for this work is greatly appreciated!  Prayer sustains the Team, and financial support helps with the cost of supplies. There is also an opportunity to support the building of the LIFT Renewal Center. By clicking on the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Donate&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; button you may make a gift to LIFT Ministries, and indicate how you would like your gift to be applied.  Thank-You! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Thou shalt decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee; and the light shall shine upon thy ways.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;   Job 22:28&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIFT Ministries&lt;/strong&gt;, in partnership with LIFT in Ghana, is supporting the creation of the &lt;strong&gt;LIFT Renewal Center&lt;/strong&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imagine&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A place for Spiritual Retreat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A place for Leadership Training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A place for Visiting Missionaries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A place to host the Walk to Emmaus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the U.S. we are blessed with the availability of 
comfortable, affordable facilities. 
But the Methodist Church in Ghana has very limited facilities for pastors and laypersons to take retreat 
for spiritual renewal,apart from expensive hotels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Together we can make this happen - We are blessed to be a blessing!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LIFT Ministries is raising money in order to build this facility 
which will be used for all these purposes as well 
as hosting Walk to Emmaus weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, LIFT has raised $5,000 to build the Center ! 
The remaining cost to complete the construction 
is approximately $60,000.
You can support this vital project by making a 
tax-deductible gift to LIFT Ministries in any amount.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.LiftRenewal.org&quot;&gt;www.LiftRenewal.org&lt;/a&gt; and click &amp;ldquo;Donate&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank-You!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Seminar - The Ministry of the Church Office</title>
      <link>http://liftrenewal.org/events/ministry-of-the-church-office</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIFT Ministries&lt;/strong&gt; presents a new Seminar designed to strengthen,encourage,and equip those persons entrusted with running the church office and assisting the Pastor &amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;Administrative Assistants, Office Managers, Church Secretaries&lt;/strong&gt;, etc. This is a very important ministry to which God calls us in order to use our spiritual gifts to their fullest to give glory to God and strengthen the Body of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are invited to spend a day away from the office to worship, engage in prayer and Bible study together,and then take a good look at the responsibilities and challenges of your job through the lens of Ministry.  Understanding that church administration is not merely a set of tasks on a job description, LIFT is offering an opportunity for participants to indeed embrace their roles as ministry,identify a variety of spiritual and practical resources available to them, and be renewed as they return to their workplace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The Ministry of the Church Office&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; is facilitated by &lt;strong&gt;Judy Gillham&lt;/strong&gt;, herself a veteran of church office administration, and currently serves as the Ministries Coordinator for LIFT Ministries. She is a woman of deep prayer and great faith, who believes that we are charged with working “as unto the Lord” in all things. Judy brings experience, compassion, and her sense of humor to this seminar and is eager to share this special day with her colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date&lt;/strong&gt;: Tuesday, April 28, 2015 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 9:00am to 2:00pm-Lunch is Included! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost&lt;/strong&gt;: $25 per Person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Saturday - February 14 - is the next LIFT Prayer Walk in the St. Paul&amp;rsquo;s United Methodist Church in San Bernardino. On the 2nd Saturday of each month we start out from a different church in the Inland Empire area in order to cover our communities with Prayer and Listen to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All are welcome! Meet at St. Paul&amp;rsquo;s UMC at 9am. We’ll have a brief time of worship and prayer together, then form small groups to walk and pray silently through the community. A couple people will be asked to remain in the Sanctuary to keep vigil while we walk, interceding for the walkers. After about 45 minutes or so, we’ll return to the church to share what God was showing us, then pray, and return home. Come and be a blessing in the community!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us. 1 John 5:14&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Distinguishing Birthmark</title>
      <link>http://liftrenewal.org/blog/a-distinguishing-birthmark</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2014 15:59:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <author>Jeremy Ricketts</author>
      <guid>http://liftrenewal.org/blog/a-distinguishing-birthmark</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Beloved, let us love one another, said the author of 1 John, for God is love. Likewise Paul in his triumphant hymn to the Corinthian church: faith, hope, and love abide, these three, and the greatest of these is love. For Christians, no less than any others, love is an essential part of the human experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But love is a tricky thing, full of delight and hurt, aspiration and risk all at the same time. Because every loving heart can be wounded, because every love-inspired promise can be broken, because every loving friendship can be severed, there lies at the heart of true Christian community the essential need for forgiveness. Indeed, if the foundation of the church is God’s grace, then the currency with which we conduct our everyday affairs is forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness originates in Jesus Christ, and grows in our hearts by his word, and bears fruit in our lives by shaping our will and guiding our actions. Before and behind us, and all along the path to God’s shalom we find forgiveness. Unforgiveness, on the other hand, prevents us from peace. It keeps us from sharing the whole nature of God. It weighs us down with uncertainty and mistrust and bitterness, sours our expression with cynicism and becomes a barrier in our path to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point in time each of us will suffer an injury at the hand of love which seems too big to let go, too important to leave out of our autobiography. But in Matthew’s gospel Jesus urges us to release such injuries and remember them no more. We are invited to see our wounds in the light of the Cross of Christ, to witness the power of the resurrection, and to remember: that our Christian community originates in the forgiveness of Christ, and is sustained in our forgiveness of one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus bids us rise above the shifting wind of our emotions and feelings. Forgiveness is meant to be a daily practice&amp;hellip; a way of life&amp;hellip; distinguishing mark of our new birth in Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>God at Work Within Us</title>
      <link>http://liftrenewal.org/blog/god-at-work-within-us</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2014 16:02:00 -0800</pubDate>

      <guid>http://liftrenewal.org/blog/god-at-work-within-us</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In all of history, there has never been a king like Jesus. He holds no earthly crown or scepter. He covets no earthly throne or dominion. He kneels as a servant, welcomes children, touches the untouchable, and mingles with the outcasts. He came not be served, but to serve, and in his life provided the model for faithfulness to which every follower of his must forever aspire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of his followers was Paul, the “Apostle to the Gentiles”. Over the course of his ministry, Paul suffered many hardships and much persecution for the privilege of preaching the Gospel. Ultimately he was arrested and sent to Rome, where he became a martyr for the faith. It was while under arrest on his way to Rome that the church in Philippi expressed their deep love and concern for Paul, and their sense of hopelessness and grief at his circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul’s response—the Letter to Philippi we find in scripture—is a ringing testimonial to the faithfulness of Christ over his church, and the confidence we can have in Christ no matter our circumstances. Paul reminds the church that as individual believers, we come to Christ in profoundly personal ways…but our deeply personal faith is never private. For through our baptism we are incorporated into the Body of Christ, and through the promised Holy Spirit we are all being knit together so that our gifts and graces work in concert together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus we bear one another’s burdens, rejoice in one another’s victories, and bolster one another in times of powerlessness and in the face of death. All of this is not by our own strength; it is the work of Christ in us and through us. Christ himself is transforming the world, having first redeemed in his own life and death. As we become like him—have his mind among us—he is completing his transforming work in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is an old hymn of our faith which begins with these words: Once to every man and nation, comes the moment to decide, In the strife of truth with falsehood, for the good or evil side;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hymn writer is partially right…it is rare that a heroic choice between truth and falsehood or good and evil is suddenly and clearly required. And in those moments of crisis or judgment, when the dazzling and radiating light of truth stands over against the shadowy darkness of evil, even a small child is capable of making a prudent and righteous choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for Christians, the path of faithfulness more often unwinds itself in long seasons of ordinariness, and in the small habits, the “second-nature” choices we make while we tackle the mundane matters of everyday living. Not once, but every morning, we rise to live as Christ’s disciples in this world. Not once, but every hour throughout the day, we listen—to scripture, to friends, to the witness of God’s Holy Spirit, to the inquisitiveness of our own minds—hoping to hear a living Word and seeking the Holy Spirit’s guidance, so that we may be more faithful. Not once, but every night, we lie down to rest ourselves trusting not in our righteousness, but in the saving grace of Jesus our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The true “heroes” of Christian discipleship are not made in a day, but daily. To ignore the opportunities for faithfulness in the little matters of everyday life is to ignore a very central part of Jesus teaching. When crisis times do come—times of spiritual harvest or judgment— they will not make a person suddenly righteous or unrighteous. They simply reveal who already is.&lt;/p&gt;
